🚗 Car Management System (Java OOP Project)

This project is a simple Car Management System built using Java OOP concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, cloning, ArrayLists, and sorting algorithms.
It demonstrates how to manage a list of cars with different attributes and perform operations like adding, removing, sorting, and finding the best car.

✨ Features

✅ Car Class

Attributes: CarBrand, Model, EngineNo, FuelAverage, Price, ComfortLevel

Constructors (default, parameterized, copy constructor)

toString() method for display

Implements Cloning (Cloneable)

✅ Carlist Class

Stores multiple cars in an ArrayList<Car>

Methods:

addCar() → Add car (avoids duplicate EngineNo)

removeCar() → Remove a car by EngineNo

printAllCars() → Display all cars

findBestCarByFuelEfficiency() → Bubble sort cars by fuel average & print the best one

sortCarByPrice() → Bubble sort cars by price (highest first)

DeepClone()--> Make Deep Clone

✅ Main Class

Creates sample car objects

Demonstrates:

Adding cars

Avoiding duplicates

Sorting cars

Finding best fuel-efficient car

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Java

Concepts Used:

OOP (Encapsulation, Constructors, Copy Constructor, Polymorphism via toString())

Java Collections (ArrayList)

Sorting (Manual Bubble Sort)

Exception Handling (Cloneable support)

🚀 Example Output
Car added Successfully
------------------------
Car added Successfully
------------------------
Car is already Present
------------------------
Cars sorted according to Fuel Efficiency (Best first).
Best Car by Fuel Efficiency:
Car Brand is Honda
Model is Civic
Engine no is XYZ1234
Price is 9000000.0
Fuel Average is 13.0 Km/hr
Comfort level is 9.5/10
------------------------
Cars Sorted Acc to Price
------------------------
Car 1:
Car Brand is Honda
Model is Civic
...
Car 2:
Car Brand is Toyota
Model is Grande
...

📌 Future Improvements

Add searchCar() by brand or model

Allow updating car details

Add sorting by comfort level / brand name

Create a menu-driven program with user input
